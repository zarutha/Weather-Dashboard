# Weather-Dashboard
A responsive web application designed to quickly fetch meteorological data. Includes a search bar to input a city of choice as well as a decorative background, and modern/sleek UI. Note the minor but functional animations/transitions. Built using HTML, CSS, Javacript and uses OpenWeatherMap's Weather API.

NOTE: A valid API key is needed for code to function. You can sign up for a FREE api key at OpenWeatherMap, then once you get a key from signing up, replace line 1 in script.js, with your own key and clone the repo. (labelled clearly)
